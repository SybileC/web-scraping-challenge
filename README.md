# web-scraping-challenge

- Created a Jupyter Notebook file and used it to complete all of my scraping and analysis tasks. 

- Scraped NASA Mars News, JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image, Mars Facts, Mars Hemispheres using BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

- Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs.
